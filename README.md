# genetic_algorithm

The purpose of the class presented below is to create a genetic algorithm capable of optimizing the values of a user-defined dictionary. Its main objective is to find the combination of values that maximizes the response of a specific evaluation function.

The evaluation function receives as input a dictionary to be optimized, initially populated with random values generated by the genetic algorithm. This function performs mathematical operations on these values and produces a score.

The process begins with the creation of an initial population of n individuals. Each individual is represented by a dictionary that shares the same keys as the user-defined dictionary, but with random values appropriate for its data type. Each individual in the population is evaluated using the evaluation function, and the best individuals are selected based on the score obtained.

The genetic algorithm analyzes the patterns of changes between these selected individuals and generates a new generation whose values are close to the best individuals, while incorporating a random component. The new population is subjected to evaluation and the best performing individuals are selected again.

This process of selecting, creating new generations, and evaluating is repeated in a loop until the user-defined number of generations is reached. It is important to note that a new generation is not generated until all individuals in the current population are evaluated.

In each generation, the best individual is saved in a CSV file, thus allowing its recovery at moments after the execution of the algorithm. At the end of the evaluation of all the individuals of the last generation, the best individual is selected as the final result of the genetic algorithm.
